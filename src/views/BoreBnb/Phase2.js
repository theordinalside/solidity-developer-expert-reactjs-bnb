          Now, let's delve into how land fits seamlessly into our thriving
          ecosystem. 🏞️
          <br />
          <br />
          Within The Ordinal Side, land represents a tangible and valuable
          ownership stake in our ecosystem. It serves as the foundational NFT
          (non-fungible token) of our platform. As creators list their projects
          on our platform, a portion of the service fees generated will be
          distributed among our esteemed land holders. We're eagerly
          anticipating the opportunity to reveal further details and intricacies
          of this process at a later date, ensuring transparency and fairness
          throughout. 🏰💼

          unveiled upon the release of our platform and land mint. We appreciate
          your patience and enthusiasm as we continue to refine and enhance The
          Ordinal Side experience. Stay tuned for further updates and
          announcements. 📢🔜
